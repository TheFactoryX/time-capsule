ANTI-LICENSE

This is not a license. This is an invitation.
This is raw material from the factory floor.

Take it. Use it. Break it. Fix it.
Sell it. Give it away. Forget about it.

We don't care. Strange people make strange things.

Therefore:
No warranty. No support. No rules. No liability.

Just like life. Just like art.

If you need permission, you're thinking too much.
